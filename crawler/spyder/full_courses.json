European modernity has tended to posit images, sounds, and performances as signs of a world \u201cout there\u201d that recreated in ritual contexts facilitate individual transcendence through an almost spiritual experience. We will examine how West African and African diasporic notions of modern aesthetics tend to offer a counterpoint by enacting theories of representation that are more explicitly performative and socially dialogic. In the 1950s and 1960s people across Africa and African peoples in the Americas and the Caribbean fought for political rights and sovereignty. Aesthetic forms were crucial to these projects. Political power was contested in economic and institutional ways, but people experienced it through their bodies and senses. The power to control political and economic order is enacted in the realms of signs, desires, and value. Moral dichotomies between beautiful or ugly, expensive or cheap, important or illegible, appear to be about aesthetics alone but are in fact ways that power is produced, naturalized, and contested. We examine art media as well as political and social forms as a way to understand how broad forms of power shape both everyday and spectacular experiences and how individuals and collectives use expression as a way to contest the terms of power. In political terms, we explore rituals of state as events through which power is produced and contested in embodied ways. Producing loyal citizens requires a nation-state to create rituals that orient people to feel like they are part of a shared collective experience.

At the center of these forms of violence are the control of breath as life force and sign of freedom. This course examines the murder of Eric Garner in 2014 in a police-executed choke hold as a key event that both harkens back to a long history of lynchings and shootings and also to a history of how Black communities have organized around and resisted these forms of violence. Aesthetic representation has been intimately connected to anti-Black racial violence from photographs and postcards of lynchings in which white perpetrators pose alongside dead Black bodies to representations of Emmitt Till\u2019s mutilated body at his funeral in an open casket to video of Rodney King\u2019s beating to the continuing stream of video and images of extra-judicial killings of black citizens. Generations of artists in film, theater, painting/sculpture, dance, and across media have challenged and confronted this aesthetics of violence. This course explores theories of ritual and performance to understand how artists and communities come together as collectives to contextualize and re-present impossible terrors. Artists and political organizers use aesthetics and collective action to transform the horror of being subject to violence at any moment into rituals of potential social transformation. This course then teaches students theories of ritual and performance as ways that communities have historically engaged and confronted histories of anti-Black violences in order to conceive of new future possibilities in the face of disciplinary actions meant to contain and choke black people(s).

In this course we will examine decision making from both behavioral and neurobiological points of view. Specifically, we will learn about different methods used in psychology, economics, and neuroscience (e.g. operant conditioning, game theory, reinforcement learning, prospect theory, electrophysiology, neuroimaging) to study decision making at various levels, from cognitive processes to underpinning neural activity and mechanisms."}, {"code": "51.09", "course_name": "PSYC 51.09 Human Memory", "course_link": "https://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/departments-programs-undergraduate/psychological-and-brain-sciences/psyc-psychological-and-brain-sciences/psyc-51-09", "desc": "Knowing how our brains organize and spontaneously retrieve memories is at the heart of understanding the basis of the ongoing internal dialog of our conscious thoughts.

When our emotions go badly awry, we suffer debilitating mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety.

The very same films, however, are all too often understood by many people as mere entertainment. In this class, we will consider what movies, if treated critically, may teach us about Middle East history. Beginning with a brief introduction to film and media studies, we will contemplate where the Middle East fits into this field of inquiry. Once establishing how we will approach movies and the Middle East throughout the term, we will navigate a number of key themes together, from war, memory, and migration to (mis)information, revolution, and representation. Along the way, we will watch everything from indie films to big budget blockbusters. Regardless of the exact form these projects assume, all of the pictures we explore will generate debate and discussion around the past and present. Among the topics we will cover are the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, European colonialism, and America\u2019s legacy in the Arab world. To assist us on this journey across the Middle East and well beyond its boundaries, we will engage several primary sources, with motion pictures at the forefront. These thought-provoking items will empower us to partake in conversations that traverse languages, national borders, historical eras, and artistic genres, enabling us to view the Middle East in an entirely new way."}, {"code": "15.01", "course_name": "MES 15.01 The Craft of Fiction: A Masterclass with Alaa Al Aswany", "course_link": "https://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/departments-programs-undergraduate/middle-eastern-studies/mes-middle-eastern-studies/mes-15-01", "desc": "Fiction presents an abundance of rich and creative possibilities.

This course will explore the complex issues related to identity and democracy in the Baltics through two four-week modules, one based at Vilnius University in Lithuania, and the other at the University of Tartu in Estonia. The courses will focus on two themes. One is how Baltic identity has been influenced by the region's experiences as part of the Soviet Union, its current proximity to Russia, and its many ties to Europe. You will explore the impact of the Soviet era on the cultural and political identity of the Baltics, and how this history continues to shape contemporary issues related to national identity, language, and political participation. You will also analyze the current geopolitical climate and how the region's unique position between East and West impacts its identity and its democratic development. Another theme is related to ethnic and gender discrimination in the Baltics. You will explore the challenges that women and minority groups face in the region, and the progress that has been made towards greater equality and inclusion. You will also consider the intersection of identity and discrimination, and how these issues can impact the development of a cohesive and democratic society. Throughout the course, you will also examine how the emergent Baltic identity and identity-related issues present both possibilities and challenges to democratic consolidation in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, and in other countries throughout the region.

Observers around the world warn of imminent threats to democracy in both Western and non-Western countries, and non-democratic powers like China and Russia offer alternative forms of governance that appeal to many global leaders.

If so, what does democratic erosion in the contemporary period look like, why is it happening, and how does it differ from processes of democratic breakdown in earlier historical periods? If processes of democratic erosion are underway, how can they be resisted and democracy strengthened?

Because the experience of mothering connects the intimate experiences of individuals to larger structures and forces, and because reproduction is such a fundamental (if varied) biological and social experience, the topic lends its especially well to comparative analysis. This specific course employs the framework of mothering to compare the experiences of two communities constructed as \u201cforeign\u201d to the United States: Chicanx/Latinxs and Asian Americans. In situating motherhood as an ideological and cultural construction rather than a universal or natural phenomenon, we will compare closely affiliated histories of miscegenation, transracial adoption, domestic migrant labor, and assisted reproduction across the Americas and the Asian diaspora. How are these phenomena given especially potent life in Chicanx/Latinx, Asian American, and Asian diasporic cultural representations such as literature, documentary film, and television?

To understand the island\u2019s history, students are expected to read what historians and writers have written about Haiti; and to read the primary letters of frantic French planters, rebellious African slaves, egalitarian peasants, entrepreneurial market women, conscientious revolutionaries, exuberant military generals, loquacious politicians, feared dictators, and dreaded militias through time. The course will, indeed, move through four important, though overlapping, historical moments. First, we begin with an examination of the 1791-1804 Haitian Revolution when enslaved Africans revolted against the French colonial planters to successfully abolish slavery and to achieve national independence. Second, we read through the formation of grassroots and institutional democratic traditions in the nineteenth century and how they were undone during the 1915-1934 US Occupation of Haiti, where US President Woodrow Wilson ordered the American military to invade Haiti and control the island for almost two decades. Third, we will explore how the undoing of democracy led to the rise of the Francois and Jean-Claude Duvalier dictatorship (1957-1971) and its dreaded militia called the tonton makout militia (often spelled in the following French orthography: tonton macoutes). Finally, we will conclude the class by looking at how and why the Haitian peasantry overthrew the dictatorship to replace it with the democratically elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide (1991)."}, {"code": "94.08", "course_name": "HIST 94.08 History and Culture of the Jews I: The Classical Period", "course_link": "https://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/departments-programs-undergraduate/history/hist-history/hist-94-08", "desc": "A survey of the history and culture of the Jews from the post-Biblical period to the Middle Ages."}, {"code": "92.02", "course_name": "HIST 92.02 Nationalism and Revolution in the Caribbean", "course_link": "https://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/departments-programs-undergraduate/history/hist-history/hist-92-02", "desc": "The islands of the Caribbean have served as the site for two of the most significant revolutionary upheavals of the modern era-the Haitian Revolution and the Cuban Revolution and have produced anti-colonial luminaries such as Jos\u00e9 Marti, Frantz Fanon, Marcus Garvey, and Claudia Jones.

The long-term consequences of these atmospheric changes remain unknown, but there is already strong evidence that the Earth is rapidly moving into a less biologically diverse, less forested, much warmer, and probably wetter and stormier state. Research on climate change points to a particular irony: human actions have unprecedented impact on the environment, but this produces effects that are increasingly out of human control. Inside that conundrum lies another. Scientists have certain strategies to address urgent environmental challenges, but what of the arts and the humanities? What can practitioners in these fields, in dialogue with the sciences, offer in this moment of climatic disruption and political inaction? To what new modes of visualization does global warming give rise, and how do these aesthetic innovations allow us to live with and through environmental change? What ontological status can be assigned to various biological, geological, and meteorological \u2018actors\u2019 if human agency is no longer privileged? In taking up these questions, this course recognizes that the manifold effects of climate change demand new structures of cross-disciplinary thinking and critical engagement.

We will examine how West African and African diasporic notions of modern aesthetics tend to offer a counterpoint by enacting theories of representation that are more explicitly performative and socially dialogic. In the 1950s and 1960s people across Africa and African peoples in the Americas and the Caribbean fought for political rights and sovereignty. Aesthetic forms were crucial to these projects. Political power was contested in economic and institutional ways, but people experienced it through their bodies and senses. The power to control political and economic order is enacted in the realms of signs, desires, and value. Moral dichotomies between beautiful or ugly, expensive or cheap, important or illegible, appear to be about aesthetics alone but are in fact ways that power is produced, naturalized, and contested. We examine art media as well as political and social forms as a way to understand how broad forms of power shape both everyday and spectacular experiences and how individuals and collectives use expression as a way to contest the terms of power. In political terms, we explore rituals of state as events through which power is produced and contested in embodied ways. Producing loyal citizens requires a nation-state to create rituals that orient people to feel like they are part of a shared collective experience.

Not only did anti-colonial struggles challenge colonial domination, they also envisioned heterogenous  imaginaries of \u201cfreedom\u201d that would shape their futures for years to come. Freedom was never a static idea.  In international conferences like those of the Afro-Asian Writers Association, previously colonised people vigorously debated the meanings and visions of freedom for postcolonial futures. Women, workers, and indigenous peoples drew attention to the fissures in national independence that prioritised certain hegemonic voices over others. Moreover, debates on what constituted \u201cfreedom\u201d under decolonization were also shaped by  the geopolitical and cultural politics of the global Cold War.
